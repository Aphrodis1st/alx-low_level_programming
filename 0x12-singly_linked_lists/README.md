# Singly linked lists

##  Normally "A singly linked list is a linear data structure in which the elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations and each element is connected only to its next element using a pointer." 


# Now we are going to look at how it works through this ALX project. 

## Instructions are the same according to my previous READMEs, like:

			-> All your files should end with a new line.
			-> Your code should use the Betty style.
			-> You are not allowed to use global variables.
			-> No more than 5 functions per file. 
			-> Only to use _putchar for the output.
			-> All your files will be compiled using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
			-> Create a header file contains all the prototypes.
			-> All your header files should be include guarded


# Now let's look what they have installed for me.

	1. Write a function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.

		* Prototype: size_t print_list(const list_t *h);
		* Return: the number of nodes
		* Format: see example
		* If str is NULL, print [0] (nil)
		* You are allowed to use printf

	2. Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.

		* Prototype: size_t list_len(const list_t *h);

	3. Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.

		* Prototype: list_t *add_node(list_t **head, const char *str);
		* Return: the address of the new element, or NULL if it failed
		* str needs to be duplicated
		* You are allowed to use strdup

	4. Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list.

		* Prototype: list_t *add_node_end(list_t **head, const char *str);
		* Return: the address of the new element, or NULL if it failed
		* str needs to be duplicated
		* You are allowed to use strdup

	5. Write a function that frees a list_t list.

		* Prototype: void free_list(list_t *head);

	6. Write a function that prints You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n before the main function is execute

		* You are allowed to use the printf function.

	7. Write a 64-bit program in assembly that prints Hello, Holberton, followed by a new line.

		* You are only allowed to use the printf function
		* You are not allowed to use interrupts
		* Your program will be compiled using nasm and gcc:
