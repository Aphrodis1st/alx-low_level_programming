## More on  Bit Manipulation

##  Normally "Bit manipulation in C programming refers to the manipulation of individual bits (binary digits) within a variable, typically an integer or a character, using bitwise operators. This technique is often used to perform low-level operations on binary data, flags, and to optimize certain algorithms or data structures." 


# Now we are going to look at how it works through this ALX project. 

# Instructions are the same according to my previous READMEs, like:

			-> All your files should end with a new line.
			-> Your code should use the Betty style.
			-> You are not allowed to use global variables.
			-> No more than 5 functions per file. 
			-> Only to use _putchar for the output.
			-> All your files will be compiled using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
			-> Create a header file contains all the prototypes.
			-> All your header files should be include guarded


# Now let's look what they have installed for me.

	1. Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

		* Prototype: unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);
		* where b is pointing to a string of 0 and 1 chars
		* Return: the converted number, or 0 if
			->there is one or more chars in the string b that is not 0 or 1
			->b is NULL

	2. Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

		* Prototype: void print_binary(unsigned long int n);
		* Format: see example
		* You are not allowed to use arrays
		* You are not allowed to use malloc
		* You are not allowed to use the % or / operators



	3. Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

		* Prototype: int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index);
		* where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to get
		* Returns: the value of the bit at index index or -1 if an error occured


	4. Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

		* Prototype: int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);
		* where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to set
		* Returns: 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occurred


	5. Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

		* Prototype: int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);
		* where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to set
		* Returns: 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occurred


	6. Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

		* Prototype: unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m);
		* You are not allowed to use the % or / operators
