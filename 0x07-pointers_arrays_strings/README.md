# C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

Hy, I'm glad that you made it here. You are absolutely at the right place.
As we are going to look out for additional to pointers, arrays and strings. feel confortable it was made easy to look through.

You have to remember that my codes for every project at low level programming repo, uses Betty style in each line of codes and usually uses  gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 for compilation process.

No more than 5 functions per file, no printf or puts. Instead I use putchar.

Now let's look what made this thing

	1. Write a program that fills memory with a constant byte.

		* The _memset() function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b
		* Returns a pointer to the memory area s

	2. Write a function that copies memory area.

		* The _memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest
		* Returns a pointer to dest

	3. Write a function that locates a character in a string.

		* Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s, or NULL if the character is not found

	4. Write a function that gets the length of a prefix substring.

		* Returns the number of bytes in the initial segment of s which consist only of bytes from accept

	5. Write a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.

		* The _strpbrk() function locates the first occurrence in the string s of any of the bytes in the string accept
		* Returns a pointer to the byte in s that matches one of the bytes in accept, or NULL if no such byte is found

	6. Write a function that locates a substring.

		* The _strstr() function finds the first occurrence of the substring needle in the string haystack. The terminating null bytes (\0) are not compared
		* Returns a pointer to the beginning of the located substring, or NULL if the substring is not found.

	7. Write a function that prints the chessboard.

	8. Write a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.

		* Format: see example
		* You are allowed to use the standard library
