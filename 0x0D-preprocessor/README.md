Hy, I'm glad that you made it here. You are absolutely at the right place. As we are going to look out for Recursions in C programming. feel confortable it was made easy to look through.

You have to remember that my codes for every project at low level programming repo, uses Betty style in each line of codes and usually uses
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 for compilation process.

No more than 5 functions per file, no printf or puts. Instead I use putchar.

No printf, puts, calloc, realloc.

Now let's look what made this thing

	1. Create a header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024. 


	2. Create a header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.


	3. Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.


		* You are allowed to use the standard library


	4. Write a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x.



	5. Write a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y.
