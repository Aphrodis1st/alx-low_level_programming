# This is about C programming language by looking at pointers, arrays and strings all to gether.

There is a bunch of exercises I have prepared for during this session and they have 100% no copyright restrictions in uses.

1. Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

		* This program follows betty style
		* This program uses gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 to be compiled. Every program I make follow these rules.

2. Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.

3. Write a function that returns the length of a string.

4. Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

5. Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

6. Write a function that reverses a string.

7. Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.


8. Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

9. Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

10. Write a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.


11. Write a function that convert a string to an integer.

12. Create a program that generates random valid passwords for the program
