# C - More pointers, arrays and strings

Welcome! Here we'll talking about an advanced tasks about C programming in Pointers, Arrays, and Strings.

You can refere to my previous projects in other directories that contains awesome C programs

Notice that this program follows betty style and they are compiled by gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89.

These are the programs to go for:

	1. Write a program that concatenates two strings.

		* This program appends the src string to the dest string, 
		  overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, 
		  and then adds a terminating null byte.

		* Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest

	2. Write a program that concatenates two strings.

		* The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, 
		  except that it will use at most n bytes from src and src 
		  does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes.
	
	3. Write a program that copies a string.

		* Your program should work exactly like strncpy

	4. Write a program that compares two strings.

		* The function should work exactly like strcmp

	5. Write a program that reverses the content of an array of integers.

		* Where n is the number of elements of the array

	6. Write a program that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

	7. Write a function that capitalizes all words of a string.

		* Separators of words: space, tabulation, new line, ,, ;, ., !, ?, ", (, ), {, and }

	8. Write a program that encodes a string into 1337.

		* Letters a and A should be replaced by 4
		* Letters e and E should be replaced by 3
		* Letters o and O should be replaced by 0
		* Letters t and T should be replaced by 7
		* Letters l and L should be replaced by 1
		* Prototype: char *leet(char *);
		* You can only use one if in your code
		* You can only use two loops in your code
		* You are not allowed to use switch
		* You are not allowed to use any ternary operation
