Hy, I'm glad that you made it here. You are absolutely at the right place. As we are going to look out for Recursions in C programming. feel confortable it was made easy to look through.

You have to remember that my codes for every project at low level programming repo, uses Betty style in each line of codes and usually uses
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 for compilation process.

No more than 5 functions per file, no printf or puts. Instead I use putchar.

No printf, puts, calloc, realloc.

Now let's look what made this thing

	1. Write a function that prints a name. 


	3. Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.

		* where size is the size of the array
		* and action is a pointer to the function you need to use

	4. Write a function that searches for an integer.

		* where size is the number of elements in the array array
		* cmp is a pointer to the function to be used to compare values
		* int_index returns the index of the first element for which the cmp function does not return 0
		* If no element matches, return -1
		* If size <= 0, return -1



	5. Write a program that performs simple operations.

		* +: addition
		* -: subtraction
		* *: multiplication
		* /: division
		* %: modulo

		("EACH PROTOTYPE IS LOCATED IN MY HEADER FILE 'main.h', make sure to check for it")
