Hy, I'm glad that you made it here. You are absolutely at the right place. As we are going to look out for Recursions in C programming. feel confortable it was made easy to look through.

You have to remember that my codes for every project at low level programming repo, uses Betty style in each line of codes and usually uses
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 for compilation process.

No more than 5 functions per file, no printf or puts. Instead I use putchar.

Now let's look what made this thing

	1. Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

	2. Write a function that prints a string in reverse.

	3. Write a function that returns the length of a string.

	4. Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.

	5. Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.

		* If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1

	6. Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number.

	7. Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

	8. Write a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.

		* An empty string is a palindrome

	9. Write a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.

		* s2 can contain the special character *.
		* The special char * can replace any string (including an empty string)
