Hy, I'm glad that you made it here. You are absolutely at the right place. As we are going to look out for Recursions in C programming. feel confortable it was made easy to look through.

You have to remember that my codes for every project at low level programming repo, uses Betty style in each line of codes and usually uses
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 for compilation process.

No more than 5 functions per file, no printf or puts. Instead I use putchar.

No printf, puts, calloc, realloc.

Now let's look what made this thing

	1. Define a new type struct dog with the following elements:


		* name, type = char *
		* age, type = float
		* owner, type = char * 

	2. Write a function that initialize a variable of type struct dog

		* Prototype: void init_dog(struct dog *d, char *name, float age, char *owner);


	3. Write a function that prints a struct dog


		* Prototype: void print_dog(struct dog *d);
		* Format: see example bellow
		* You are allowed to use the standard library
		* If an element of d is NULL, print (nil) instead of this element. (if name is NULL, print Name: (nil))
		* If d is NULL print nothing.

	4. Define a new type dog_t as a new name for the type struct dog.


	5. Write a function that creates a new dog.

		* Prototype: dog_t *new_dog(char *name, float age, char *owner);
		* You have to store a copy of name and owner
		* Return NULL if the function fails


		("EACH PROTOTYPE IS LOCATED IN MY HEADER FILE 'main.h', make sure to check for it")
