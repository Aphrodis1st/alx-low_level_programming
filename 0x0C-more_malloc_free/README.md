Hy, I'm glad that you made it here. You are absolutely at the right place. As we are going to look out for Recursions in C programming. feel confortable it was made easy to look through.

You have to remember that my codes for every project at low level programming repo, uses Betty style in each line of codes and usually uses
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 for compilation process.

No more than 5 functions per file, no printf or puts. Instead I use putchar.

No printf, puts, calloc, realloc.

Now let's look what made this thing

	1. Write a function that allocates memory using malloic. 

		* Prototype: void *malloc_checked(unsigned int b);
		* Returns a pointer to the allocated memory
		* if malloc fails, the malloc_checked function should cause normal process 
			termination with a status value of 98 

	2. Write a function that concatenates two strings.

		* Prototype: char *string_nconcat(char *s1, char *s2, unsigned int n);
		* The returned pointer shall point to a newly allocated space in memory, 
		* which contains s1, followed by the first n bytes of s2, and null terminated
		* If the function fails, it should return NULL
		* If n is greater or equal to the length of s2 then use the entire string s2
		* if NULL is passed, treat it as an empty string


	3. Write a function that allocates memory for an array, using malloc.


		* Prototype: void *_calloc(unsigned int nmemb, unsigned int size);
		* The _calloc function allocates memory for an array of nmemb elements of size bytes 
			each and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.
		* The memory is set to zero
		* If nmemb or size is 0, then _calloc returns NULL
		* If malloc fails, then _calloc returns NULL


	4. Write a function that creates an array of integers.
