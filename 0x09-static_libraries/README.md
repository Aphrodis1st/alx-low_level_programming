# Static libraries in C programming

Hy, I'm glad that you made it here. You are absolutely at the right place.
As we are going to look out for additional to pointers, arrays and strings. feel confortable it was made easy to look through.

You have to remember that my codes for every project at low level programming repo,
uses Betty style in each line of codes and usually uses
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 for compilation process.

No more than 5 functions per file, no printf or puts. Instead I use putchar.

Now let's look what made this thing

	1. Create the static library libmy.a containing all the functions will be used.

	2. Create a script called create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library called liball.a 
	   from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
